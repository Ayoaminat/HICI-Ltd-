  The food category that are at the lowest risk with total risk below 3.The food category such as:
- soups, broths, sauces and condiments
- prepared dishes and snacks
- confectionery
- wild caught fish and products thereof (other than crustaceans and molluscs) (obsolete)
- dietetic foods, food supplements, fortified foods
- cephalopods and products thereof

Food category that are at the low risk will generate more revenue to the company because the company will export more of them.
